# RemoteSwitch

RemoteSwitch is wireless relay (without the IOT garbage) that helps me hate fewer things.

I hate flipping a switch and hearing a ceiling fan start to spin, but no light turns on!

I hate walking across a dark room and groping for a light switch that's pointless by the time I get to it!

The remote switch is powered by mains voltage and accepts input from a normal light switch and 2 momentary switches.  Two relay channels allow independent control of lights vs fan.
